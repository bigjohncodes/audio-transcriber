[0.00s --> 6.28s] My name is Basi A.I.E. Mrs. and your chemistry chef or today.
[6.28s --> 20.68s] And today we'll be looking at the demonstration of identification on Khashom, Iones, and Zinc, Iones.
[20.68s --> 28.52s] And the objectives, expected objectives for this lesson, will be that at the end of the lesson,
[28.52s --> 38.40s] the students should be able to list reagents needed for identification of Khashom, Iones, and Zinc, Iones.
[38.40s --> 45.44s] Lizzy apparatus needed for the identification of Khashom, Iones, and Zinc, Iones.
[45.44s --> 55.28s] Three, demonstrate the process of identification of Khashom, Iones, and Zinc, Iones, with appropriate reagents.
[55.28s --> 66.48s] And finally, should be able to write or report the inference expected.
[66.48s --> 68.48s] We'll take the first one.
