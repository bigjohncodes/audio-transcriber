[0.00s --> 5.00s] Aksu, aksu.
[5.00s --> 11.00s] Hello everyone, my name is Basi Aie Mrs. Amiak,
[11.00s --> 15.00s] I'm your chemistry teacher for today.
[15.00s --> 24.00s] And today we'll continue with our qualitative analysis.
[25.00s --> 32.00s] For today we'll be looking at, sorry, see where it is.
[34.00s --> 37.00s] Let's go.
[37.00s --> 40.00s] Okay.
[40.00s --> 41.00s] Yeah.
[41.00s --> 43.00s] You will start all the way.
[43.00s --> 45.00s] Okay.
[45.00s --> 46.00s] Two.
[46.00s --> 49.00s] One, two.
[49.00s --> 50.00s] Action.
[50.00s --> 52.00s] Good day everyone.
[52.00s --> 55.00s] My name is Basi Aie Mrs. Amiak,
[55.00s --> 58.00s] I'm your chemistry chef for today.
[58.00s --> 65.00s] And today we'll be looking at the demonstration of identification on
[65.00s --> 72.00s] Karsham Iones and Zing Iones.
[72.00s --> 76.00s] And the objectives, expected objectives for this lesson,
[76.00s --> 80.00s] will be that at the end of the lesson,
[80.00s --> 87.00s] the students should be able to list regions needed for identification of Karsham Iones
[87.00s --> 90.00s] and Zing Iones.
[90.00s --> 97.00s] Lizzy apparatus needed for the identification of Karsham Iones and Zing Iones.
[97.00s --> 104.00s] Three, demonstrate the process of identification of Karsham Iones and Zing Iones
[104.00s --> 107.00s] with appropriate regions.
[107.00s --> 118.00s] And finally, should be able to write or report the inference expected.
[118.00s --> 121.00s] We'll take the first one.
